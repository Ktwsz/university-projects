# Readme
Set of all things worth sharing from my classes

Below are short descriptions for repos that don't have their own readmes.

## Differential equations project
Program solves differential equations using finite element method, integrals are implemented using gaussian quadrature.

## Geometric algorithms class
Set of jupyter notebooks containing implementations of:
<ol>
    <li> Graham algorithm for calculating convex hull</li>
    <li> Jarvis algorithm for calculating convex hull</li>
    <li> Triangulation of monotone polygon</li>
    <li> Sweep line algorithm for finding intersections in set of segments</li>
</ol>


## Geometric algorithms project
Implementation of kd tree and quad tree

## Java class
